      <h2>About the site</h2>
      <p>Probably more interesting than me would be the things about the site. What its made with and how things work.</p>
      <p>This will be updated as things are changed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Using Vue to create the frontend. I generally use Next.js, so I wanted to see how making a site in Vue would be.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Repository in GitHub of course but also using their action workflow with Azure for building and deploying.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a>
          </h4>
          <p>Building, deploying and hosting the site on Azure. Straight forward process for setting up static web apps.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
