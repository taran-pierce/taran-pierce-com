        <p>Set up with Next.js 10 and React 17, this site is also using Cloudinary and Contentful but is just a playground for me to mess around with things.</p>
        <p>The main reason I put this site together at the time was because of AWS. I wanted to be able to explore some of their services in a simple low risk area that does not get much traffic.</p>
